This directory contains a number of files to ease the parsing of
arguments passed to an evaluable function/predicate or action.

pu-enum.c : contains a number of functions which are mostly deprecated
and only used for GenoM2/OpenPRS binding... forget it. Chances are
that you do not need this.

pu-genom.c : define a number of function to encode and decode basic
types from GenoM (i.e. C structures) to OpenPRS (Term *). Encodage is from PRS (Term *)
to C, and Decodage is from C Struct to PRS (Term *).

pu-parse-tl.c: contains functions and macros to parse OpenPRS TermList
(i.e. the list of arguments passed to evaluable functions/predidates
and actions. In external C/C++ code, you should use these to properly
grab the arguments. You always pass a pointer to the type you want to
grab and after the call, your pointer points to the object which DOES
NOT belong to you... most of these functions return a boolean which
TRUE if the parsing went fine, FALSE otherwise. Check the code for
more information as how to use it.

pu-mk-term.c: contains function to create proper Term * in OpenPRS
(most likely to return them as the result of an evaluable function or
action.

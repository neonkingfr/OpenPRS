Open PRS is an open source version of PRS (Procedural Reasoning Systems) / Propice. 

It is based on C-PRS and Propice... which were themselves inspired from the
Lisp PRS originaly developped at SRI International.

PRS has been used for a wide variety of application, from Mobile robot
execution control to Space Shuttle operational procedure execution.

If you have not idea at all what it is doing... well, you should probably
just stop here and look at other fun open source tools.

LICENCE
-------

I am not really an expert in Licence, but I believe that what I am using is
what people call BSD like licence... i.e. you can do whatever you do with
it, providing the original copyright and licence are included...

Anyway, it is not that long, so I put it here again (please read it once, at
least):

PREREQUISITES
-------------

Open PRS needs the following tools to be installed on the system before you can
compile it:

- cc (or gcc)
- X11 Release 6
- Some version of Motif, such as Morif itself, Lesstif, or Open Motif
- Perl (I think we use it, but I am not 100% sure), but perl is a good tool
  to have around anyway... even if I hate it.
- The GNU make utility, version 3.79 or higher. Open PRS Makefiles use some
  GNU make extensions and thus won't work with other make implementations. 
  Note the GNU make is the standard make on most Linux systems.
  (<http://www.gnu.org/software/make/make.html>).
- mkdep, the dependencies generator from CNRS/LAAS. Mkdep has many
  features that other dependencies generators miss, and even more. 
  (<http://www.laas.fr/~matthieu/mkdep/>). 
- latex if you want to typeset the documentation (to postscript or to PDF).
- acrobat reader if you want to read the documentation.


SUPPORTED PLATFORMS
-------------------

Open PRS is known to run on many platforms (in fact, I still have to find a Unix
on which it did not run):

- SPARC Solaris (tested on Solaris 2.5.1 through Solaris 9),
- x86 Linux (tested on many of them)
- MacOS X (using Apple X11)
- VxWorks (68x00, PPC)
- ...

In any case, the source are provided and it has never been a problem to
recompile it on a new architecture. We even had a version running under
Windows 95, Windows NT, etc but this was a long time ago.

GETTING Open PRS
----------------

The latest Open PRS version is available for download from:
<http://www.laas.fr/~felix/openprs/>. 

INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS
-------------------------

Open PRS does not use any automatic  configuration tool... (I never had the
time to do it, but if you are willing to give it a shot, let me know).

Usually, you just untar the source directory (src) in your open-prs
directory, then just create a build directory at the same level than the src
directory.

If you intend to compile it for more than one architecture, just create a
$TARGET subdirectory in the build directory ($TARGET has often a value which
explicit the current architecture/os such as i386-linux or sparc-solaris or
powerpc-darwin). Then cd in this $TARGET directory and execute:

	../../src/util/mk_oprs_bin_tree <path to the src dir> <architecture>

exemple:
	../../src/util/mk_oprs_bin_tree /usr/local/open-prs/src sparc-solaris


(if you did not create a $TARGET subdirectory, you can remove the first ../
from the previous command)

	make depend
	make

Do not forget the make depend (it does create files which are needed in the
next step).

	make install

Can be also done (although you can run it from the build directory)... check
the path where it will be installed in the site.make file created in your
build/$TARGET directory.

RUNNING Open PRS
----------------

There are a number of environment variable of interest to control Open PRS:

OPRS_DATA_PATH
OPRS_ID_CASE
OPRS_MP_HOST
OPRS_MP_PORT
OPRS_SERVER_HOST
OPRS_SERVER_PORT
OPRS_DOC_DIR

Check the full documentation to see what value they should take. The most
critical one is OPRS_DATA_PATH which should point to a column separated list
of directories where Open PRS will look for data files.

if you're using the C-Shell:

setenv OPRS_DATA_PATH ./data:/usr/local/open-prs/data

if you're using a Bourne shell variant (sh, ksh, bash): 

export OPRS_DATA_PATH=./data:/usr/local/open-prs/data

You can start an OP Editor with:

ope

an Open XPRS with:

xoprs -n foo -a -A

etc... 

(I think it is time for you to look at the full documentation or at the
primer... if I can find where I put it).

Reporting Problems / Getting Help
---------------------------------

A mailing list has been created for Open-PRS users. Please subscribe to
this list if you want to send problem reports or support requests.
To subscribe, go to <http://sympa.laas.fr/wws/open-prs/>. 

Submitting Patches and Code
---------------------------

Open PRS is open... thus if you have some code to submit which fix bugs or
improve it, you can submit me a patch (make sure your patch has the proper
licence, i.e. the same one I am using to distribute Open PRS, so I can
include it in the distribution).

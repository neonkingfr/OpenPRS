Open PRS is an open source version of PRS (Procedural Reasoning Systems) / Propice. 

It is based on C-PRS and Propice... which were themselves inspired from the
Lisp PRS originaly developped at SRI International.

PRS has been used for a wide variety of application, from Mobile robot
execution control to Space Shuttle operational procedure execution.

If you have not idea at all what it is doing... well, you should probably
just stop here and look at other fun open source tools.

This file is called INSTALL... and guess what... the INSTALL procedure really depends of what you got from the FTP site.

If you have the src package... then unpack it somewhere and check the file src/README

LICENCE
-------

I am not really an expert in Licence, but I believe that what I am using is
what people call BSD like licence... i.e. you can do whatever you do with
it, providing the original copyright and licence are included...

Anyway, it is not that long, so I put it here again (please read it once, at
least):

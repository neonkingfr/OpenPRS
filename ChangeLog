	* version.c: 1.0 Beta PatchLevel 1. I think, I fixed Robert
	Goldman problem... I am also putting HAS_READLINE in the sparc and
	linux config. Now that we are in BSD like licence, this should not
	be an issue.

	* oprs-server-main.c: filename_completion_function becomes
	rl_filename_completion_function... 

	* Makefile.dev: a missing dependancy for oprs-server-parser.l

	* lex-parser-def.l: Robert Goldman reporter a problem with the
	parsing... Indeed, we do not return when a return is being hit on
	the keyboard... reversing to Propice 2.0 code... I wish I
	could remember why this code was deleted... So much for "loging"
	ChangeLog modification.

	* oprs-server-main.c: remove "key" code left from Propice.

	* xhelp.c: Change the code to warn about the online (i.e. linked to the
	Motif widget) documentation availability.

	* README: creation...

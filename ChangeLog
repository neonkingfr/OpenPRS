2011-02-18  Francois Felix Ingrand  <felix@ingrand.net>

	* mp-register.c (read_int_from_socket): fix a 32/64 bits problem when the message passer and the client are running on 64 vs. 32 bits.

2011-02-17  Felix Ingrand  <felix@cturtle>

	* Modified the ope (OP Editor) so it does not start a graphical display when
	generating .tex doc files. As a result, the installation should
	not require a running X11 server anymore.

2011-02-07  Felix Ingrand  <felix@cturtle>

	* site.make.in and Makefile.in : do some clean up in the FLAGS mess...

2011-01-21  Francois Felix Ingrand  <felix@ingrand.net>

	* ev-predicate.c, ev-predicate.h, ev-predicate_f-pub.h, opaque-pub.h,
		  oprs-pred-func.c Clean up the evaluable predicate types to
		  make them more  acceptable to C++ code. (for PR2/ROS)

2011-01-20  Francois Felix Ingrand  <felix@ingrand.net>

	* mp.c (get_and_buffer_message): adjust some type casting for printing.

2010-11-23  Francois Felix Ingrand  <felix@ingrand.net>

	* configure.ac: Bump version number to 1.08 Beta.

2010-10-08  Francois Felix Ingrand  <felix@ingrand.net>

	* ev-predicate.c (declare_eval_pred): Use LONG-LONGP instead of
		  LONG_LONGP (to remain consistent with predicate/function name.

2010-10-07  Francois Felix Ingrand  <felix@ingrand.net>

	* ev-predicate.c (declare_eval_pred): added INTEGERP, FLOATP and
		  LONG_LONGP as evaluable predicates.

	* ev-function.c (float_to_int_ef): Allowed to pass an int...
	(int_to_float_ef): allowed to pass a float and a long long

	* oprs-init.c (parse_one_or_more): The PRS kernel should return 0 when
		  everything is OK. Thanks to Eric Engstrom at SIFT for pointing this.

2010-03-05  Francois Felix Ingrand  <felix@ingrand.net>

	* Clean up the version stuff... Now version is defined in the
	configure.ac only and then it propagates in version.c and the
	documentation with the proper PACKAGE_VERSION macro.

2010-03-02  Francois Felix Ingrand  <felix@ingrand.net>

	* version.c: Bumping patch level to 1.0.7 Beta to avoid confusion.

2010-02-22  Francois Felix Ingrand  <felix@ingrand.net>

	*  git clone http://softs.laas.fr/git/robots/openprs.git
	should give access to the git repository in anonymous mode. One
	cannot commit, but still, one can send me patches to be considered
	for inclusion in the official release.
	I also added the openprs mail list as a recipient of the the git
	messages. 

2010-02-21  Francois Felix Ingrand  <felix@ingrand.net>

	* action.c: Jeff Rye (jrye@sift.info) added a new format directive.

2010-02-18  Francois Felix Ingrand  <felix@ingrand.net>

	* oprs-parser.y: redundant code...

2010-02-17  Francois Felix Ingrand  <felix@ingrand.net>

	* user-ev-function.c (declare_user_eval_funct): DO NOT CALL an
	evaluation function TOTO... some test OPs (such as the one in
	maint.opf) use a TOTO predicate, and it is then called as a function.

	* activate.c (restore_suspended_tib) soak.c (find_aop_from_rop_for_maint_goal): still the same
	bug... progressing slowly.

	* database.c  and  consult-rop.c (consult_goal_relevant_op): Fixes some mispelling
	and bad printing.

	* oprs.c: add_goal. Fix a long standing bug with complex goals
	containing preserve and maintaint... (sorry Dave it took so long
	to fix it).

2010-01-16  Francois Felix Ingrand  <felix@ingrand.net>

	* Missing Xm include files... here and there...

	* shary-user-ev-function.c: why do we have this shary code IN OpenPRS?

	* xhelp.c: Missing Form.h.

	* ope-edit.c: Missing ToggleB.h.

	* ope-op-opf.c: Xm/SelectioB.h was not included... as a
	consequence some functions returning pointers (64 bits on SL)
	ended up returning "32bits" pointer. Stupid of me... I thought
	Motif was including all .h independently of which widget you were
	using. Because of this "false" assumption, the same problem may be
	present in other places... but at least, I (and you) know.

2010-01-07  Francois Felix Ingrand  <felix@ingrand.net>

	* mp-register.c (external_register_to_the_mp_host_prot):
	host_entry was reset by the start_mp_oprs, so I call it before
	each connect attempt (overkilling, but better safe than sorry).

	Now oprs-server (or any prs client) can properly start the
	message-passer and then successfully connect to it.

	* unification.c (matching_lenv_between_frames): Try to minimize
	void* and int mixup.

	* macro.h: bcopy and bzero should now take (void *).

2009-12-14  Francois Felix Ingrand  <felix@ingrand.net>


	* oprs-load.c (load_ptr): Now ptr can be 64 bits. Hence we dump
	and load unsgined long long (even on 32 bits machine to make the dump
	portable)... But we will get a warning upon reloading those 64
	bits address on a 32 bits machine.

2009-12-07  Francois Felix Ingrand  <felix@ingrand.net>

	* Various changes to make OpenPRS to compile on snow leopard which
	is now 64 bits by default. Hopefully, theses changes will not
	affect the 32 bits machines...

	* mp.c: time_t is a long.

2009-08-18  Felix Ingrand  <felix@laas.fr>

	* Fixed the long standing problem with lesstif enable to properly
	do an XmStringDrawImage. In fact, I did not fix lesstif (too
	complex) I used another way to do the visual trace. All this code
	should be moved to a newer graphic environment.

2009-05-09  Francois Felix Ingrand  <felix@ingrand.net>

	* oprs-type.c (debackslashify): Fixed a bug where I would report a
	"fake newline" in a string, which would greatly confuse the
	flex/bison parser about where errors are located.

2009-05-08  Francois Felix Ingrand  <felix@ingrand.net>

	* yacc-exp.y: Try to be more explicit about where we have a badly
	formed expression.


2009-03-30  Francois Felix Ingrand  <felix@ingrand.net>

	* ope-graphic.c (draw_node): Replaced XmStringDrawImage with
	XmStringDraw and it seems to work... this is rather puzzling... I
	will try to figure out why another time...

2008-07-01  Francois Felix Ingrand  <felix@ingrand.net>

	* Passage a git... not quite yet...

2008-04-03  Francois Felix Ingrand  <felix@ingrand.net>

	* ev-function.c (find_intention_id_ef): now return NIL if nothing found.

2007-12-04  Francois Felix Ingrand  <felix@ingrand.net>

	* oprs-parser.y: list_functions, not list_pred_func.
	

2007-10-17  Francois Felix Ingrand  <felix@ingrand.net>

	* lex-parser-def.l (YY_INPUT):
	yy_current_buffer->yy_is_interactive is replaced with
	YY_CURRENT_BUFFER->yy_is_interactive to please flex >2.5.4
	removed #if 0 code...

2007-06-22  Maxime Ransan  <mransan@laas.fr>

	* action.c: add 3 functions to enable openprs to write in multiple
	files. Those functions were originally meant to enable several lof
	files for an openprs application. (functions are: action_log_init
	, action_log_printf , action_log_end).

	* new_default.opf: add the corresponding action OPs to interface
	with the functions listed above.

2006-08-30  Francois Felix Ingrand  <felix@ingrand.net>

	* ev-function.c : LONG_LONG are now properly supported thru all
	evaluable functions using INTEGER (+, - , * , / etc...)

	* ev-predicate.c : LONG_LONG are now properly supported thru all
	evaluable predicates using INTEGER... (ABS, <, >, <=, >=, NUMBERP

2006-08-28  Francois Felix Ingrand  <felix@ingrand.net>

	* oprs-dump.c: New version number... to support long long...

	* Too many... added initial support for long long... beware,
	No arithmetic operation are allowed with them for
	now... Basically, you can read/print them, get them and pass them
	back to external function (which was the initial reason to add
	them). I will soon add the basic arithmetic functions and
	predicate... meanwhile check error message for UNSUPORTED types.

	* lex-macro.l: Added long long parsing.

	* ev-function.c (make_window_ef): Added a function definition...

	* xoprs-call.c: Added stdlib.h
	* oprs-rerror.c: Idem
	* oprs-cat.c: Idem
	* ope-parser.y: Idem

	* xoprs-icon.bit: char * and not unsigned char *...

	* oprs-client.c: accept_oprs_client, accept takes a socklen_t as
	arg... not an int.
	* mp.c (main): Idem...
	
	
2006-02-23  Francois Felix Ingrand  <felix@ingrand.net>

	* ope-parser.y: Fixed the effects (printing without the
	surrounding paranthesis)..

	* config.h.in: Protect the BIG_ENDIAN against redefinition.

2006-01-09  Francois Felix Ingrand  <felix@laas.fr>

	* version.c: Patchlevel 2 for the xpm/xwd fix.

2006-01-09  Francois Felix Ingrand  <felix@ingrand.net>

	* ope-graphic.h: remove the bitmap format... not really usefull
	anymore. Instrad, we now dump in xwd format which will retain all
	the server stuff.

	* ope-graphic.c (redraw_all_in_pixmap): Added a
	XFlush... useless...

2006-01-08  Francois Felix Ingrand  <felix@ingrand.net>

	* ope-icon.bit: XCreateBitmapFromData takes a char * not an
	unsigned char * anymore...

	* ope-graphic.h: Some systems seem to have M_PI and alike already
	defined... 

2005-01-28  Francois Felix Ingrand  <felix@ingrand.net>

	* ac_laas_mkdep.m4: Added to check that the mkdep is the LAAS one.

2005-01-24  Francois Felix Ingrand  <felix@laas.fr>

	* config.h.in: protect the LITTLE_ENDIAN define which can be
	sometimes already defined.

2005-01-21  Francois Felix Ingrand  <felix@ingrand.net>

	* README: Fixed a typo.

2005-01-06  Francois Felix Ingrand  <felix@laas.fr>

	* ev-function.c: Add a make_atom_ef evaluable function.

2005-01-04  Francois Felix Ingrand  <felix@laas.fr>

	* macro.h: INLINE definition now in config.h

	* Makefile.in: Fixed a small bug in the install (link) of .ad files.
	Remove the InfoPath setting in .ad files...

2005-01-03  Francois Felix Ingrand  <felix@laas.fr>

	* ac_readline.m4: Try a new readline macro.

2004-12-22  Francois Felix Ingrand  <felix@laas.fr>

	* oprs-parser.y: Removed redondant declaration

2004-12-15  Francois Felix Ingrand  <felix@ingrand.net>

	* config.h: Remove config.h.in only use config-ac.h

2004-12-03  Francois Felix Ingrand  <felix@ingrand.net>

	* oprs-cat.c (main): remove the call to setpgrp() ... not even
	sure why we need this...

	* database.c: hash_a_term remove this compilation flag for HP
	system... CANNOT_CAST_DOUBLE_IN_INT... I am not sure it is
	"meaningfull"... 

2004-12-02  Francois Felix Ingrand  <felix@ingrand.net>

	* configure.ac: Trying to use autoconf...

2004-10-07  Francois Felix Ingrand  <felix@ingrand.net>

	* opt-parser.y: This file should be removed...

	* ope-parser.y, oprs-parser.y: Remove redundant declaration of
	expr and list_expr in this file... More resent version of bison
	seems to be mor touchy about this...

2004-05-27  Francois Felix Ingrand  <felix@laas.fr>

	* version.c: 1.0 Beta PatchLevel 1. I think, I fixed Robert
	Goldman problem... I am also putting HAS_READLINE in the sparc and
	linux config. Now that we are in BSD like licence, this should not
	be an issue.

	* oprs-server-main.c: filename_completion_function becomes
	rl_filename_completion_function... 

	* Makefile.dev: a missing dependancy for oprs-server-parser.l

	* lex-parser-def.l: Robert Goldman reporter a problem with the
	parsing... Indeed, we do not return when a return is being hit on
	the keyboard... reversing to Propice 2.0 code... I wish I
	could remember why this code was deleted... So much for "loging"
	ChangeLog modification.

	* oprs-server-main.c: remove "key" code left from Propice.

2004-05-26  Francois Felix Ingrand  <felix@laas.fr>

	* xhelp.c: Change the code to warn about the online (i.e. linked to the
	Motif widget) documentation availability.

2003-09-22  Francois Felix Ingrand  <felix@ingrand.net>

	* README: creation...
